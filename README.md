# Assignemnt:

Knights Travails - [the project from the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails#assignment)

# Goal:

The task is to build a method that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
Here is how it looks in terminal.
```
  > knight_moves([3,3],[4,3])
  => You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
```

## Thoughts: 

The project was very hard, had to do a lot of googling, looking in stackoverflow and reading in geeksforgeeks(goat site).
After searching and looking for information I decided to use BFS algorithm and arrays as data structure.
